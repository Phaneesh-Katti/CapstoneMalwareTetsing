# Week 1 â†’ Advanced Command and Control (C2)

1. Understand the working of a scheduler, a service, ensure that persistence of the C2 malware sample is assured.

2. Use different DLL hijacking techniques to load and persist malicious DLLs.

3. Use images from the Internet to generate and propagate C2 commands as steg-images. Can also try using audio files like Cortana wav files. Use Stegdetect and identify how capable the tool is.

4. Employ the concept of whitelisting and blacklisting IP addresses by hosting multiple instances of an Apache Server using Virtual Hosting.

5. Understand the basics of PowerShell scripting and how PowerShell can be used to turn Windows Defender and Firewall off.

**NOTE:** Please execute the file name mentioned under the "code" heading under each serial number. This is mentioned as there may be multiple files/executables in a given folder to support the necessary functionalities. 
It may be necessary to change the Execution Policy of our PowerShell to perform certain tasks. For now, we will disable/change our execution policy to Unrestricted by ourselves manually. As an attacker, one may run a PowerShell command or script to do the same on the victim host. 
Open PowerShell as an "Administrator" and run the following command:

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force
```

It is advised to set the execution policy back to restricted (which is the default setting) after analyzing the malware behaviors.

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Force
```


You can verify the execution policy by using:

```
Get-ExecutionPolicy
```
